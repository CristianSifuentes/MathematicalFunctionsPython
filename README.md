# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This is a repository where I write about mathematical functions using and coding some examples in python, where main objective is show so me differences into them.

I wrote this repository because in the future I want come here and remember easily all highlight about mathematical functions, some differences and share all information getting in a platzi course about "Course on Mathematical Functions for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence"

## Installation

Tiene la forma de $$f(x)=mx + b$$ donde $m$ y $b$  $\in R$. 

$m$ puede ser calculada por: $$m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$$

y $b$ es el punto de corte con el eje $y$. Su dominio es $Dom_{f} = (-\infty, \infty)$. Su imagen es $Im_{f} = (-\infty, \infty)$




## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
